# Physics 115 Course Work - Fall 2023
Course work completed while enrolled in Physics 115 - Computational Physics.
+ The main focus of the course was to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's) for systems of interest within Physics.
+ The final assignment was a project of our choosing in which we explored cases presented in our textbook or related to our independent studies.
